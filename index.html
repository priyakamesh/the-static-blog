<h2>About the author</h2>

<p>Hi Friends,</p> 
<p>I am Krishnapriya Sivasubramanian, I am an newbie in the developer community. I am writing a blog for the first time in my life, feeling very happy for this. when I thought of writing a blog I first thought of my friend Rashmi and her creations. Let me tell about her creations in the upcoming section. </p>


<p>Mayakriti is my friend Rashmi's creations. I am helping her to build a beautiful, exciting website for selling her creations to all over the world. Her homemade creations are world-class. she has made a lot ladies accessories, Wall Watch, some paper quilling items etc. She is now stepping into a new venture in the art of cooking. She had done some awesome ,simple dishes and posted it in her facebook page. I am here to wrap all her creations together in one place for a better access.</p>
